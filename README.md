# DataSets
----------
1-This file includes some of the notes I took while studying Statistics and Probability.

2-After Statistics and Probability, I tried to analyze and visualize several data sets from the "seaborn" library in different ways.

3-I also tried on "breast-cancer.csv" file

4-Finally, I started to create my own dataset in a .csv file.

    4.1-I also tried 2 different ways to create my data set.
  
    4.2-The first one is to create it with the same name each time, appending the previous one to the end
  
    4.3-The second is to create a different file for each insertion with a date tag after the first name
